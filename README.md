# Workshop 03 - Templates
In this workshop, we were to design and code a couple of class templates and test it on two different instantiations. 

w3.cpp was provided to us to test our class templates.

My intention with uploading this code on GitHub is merely to build a portfilo of my work.
If you are another Seneca student please do not copy my work.
